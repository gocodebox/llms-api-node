# Keep Repo Alive
#
# This workflow ensures that cronjob workflows are not automatically disabled after 60 days of repo inactivity.
# The workflow will automatically add an empty commit if the repo's latest commitwas made more than 50 days ago. This empty commit will prevent GitHub from automatically disabling this (and other)
# cronjob actions in the repo.
